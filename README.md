## **GET_NEXT_LINE - a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor**

Compile as follows:
***cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 \<files\>.c***

Bonus version of the function allows to manage multiple file descriptors at the same time. This has also been added to the 
`libft library` [here](https://github.com/triimar/libft).
